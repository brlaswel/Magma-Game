### A Strategic Platformer

Our goal is to create a strategy game that is requires the player to solve puzzle like levels to beat the game. 
The game will allow the user to have control over 2 characters. These two characters will be controlled in unison; 
they will not be controlled seperately. The two characters will have some distinct indication as to which character
is which, and will only be able to interact with the enviroment accordingly. So character one will only be able to
interact with objects that share its distinct characteristic (i.e. color, number, ect.), and character two will do 
the same for character two objects.
  
The enviroment will idealy consist of specific paths, and obstacles that the player will have to navigate both sprites
around. If one sprite hits a roadblock, then as long as the user continues to hit the movement key of the direction of
the blocked sprite then the other will continue to move. This will allow the user to gain some independent movement
between the characters and clear the path for each character. Each level will be increasingly more difficult to solve.
