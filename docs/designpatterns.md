###Design Patterns
####Team-Magma's Design Implementation

The design pattern of the Mediator could fit into our project smoothly. It is very similiar to how we
already go about our code. The Mediator design pattern is described by the following: "Define an object 
that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from
referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently."

Currently our design pattern for the game "MAGMA" has been pretty straight forward. We create the main
object that displays all the images, and gives movement to the characters that are controlled by the
user. This is then used by another class that checks the characters positions and create an action
dependent upon what object they are running into.
