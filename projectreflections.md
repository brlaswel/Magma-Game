##Project Reflection
###Team Magma

"Magma" was a unique game to make. Once Team Magma decided on making the project a game, there were several obstacles we knew we
were going to have to face right off the bat. The first problem we had to tackle was what type of game were we going to create.
The second challenge following that was how can we make this game challenging, yet beatable. The third problem that we had to figure
out right off the bat was "who is going to work on what?".

We ended up deciding on a puzzle game where a player must navigate a map with controls that interacted between two players at the
same time. At the beginning of the project the team was using "picturebox's" in C#'s WPF libraries. While Ryan and Brandon worked on 
getting the menu going, finding sprites to use, and creating functionality for the code, Tony was tasked with research. His goal was to
see if there were any other libraries in Visual Studio's C# that we could take advantage of and make creating the game easier. Not only
did Tony end up finding a different and better path, he even then proceeded to write everything we had up to that point and more using
the Rectangle libraries.

Brandon acted as the project manager. He was not necessarily a boss of any kind, but the game was his idea so generally it was up to him
to turn his idea into a reality. The other group members could not read his mind so he was tasked with coming up with the ideas for the
game and each step that needed to be accomplished. Along with helping the group sort out who was tasked with what, Brandon also had the
task of designing the game in general. The game being his vision, he was tasked with coming up with a layout for each level in a way 
that the player could beat, but at the same time was not just a walk in the park. Brandon also kept track of all the documentation.
Usually twice a week the group would meet up, see where everybody stood, see what still needed to be accomplished and how to go about it,
and then would disperse. After the meetings, Brandon would then take care of all the documentation that needed to be turned in.

Tony did majority of the coding in the group. As mentioned above, he was tasked with seeing if there was a better way to accomplish what
we were aiming for. Not only did he find a better way, but created over half of the code that made the game functional between one set
of sprints. After that he had so much of the code already completed and split up into the appropriate classes that the group left him
in charge of the code and assisted him as needed. This kept the group from working on the same things by mistake, or causing an issue
that would have a negative effect on another piece of the code. Generally after everybody finished discussing what needed to still be
implemented, Tony would let the group know what they should try to work on and what he himself would work on. Because Tony did most
of the coding, the rest of the group had to make sure that their code would work with his and try to keep it a similiar style. Tony
also helped Ryan get our code for testing to work correctly.

Ryan was mostly the filler of the group. His most specific job in the group ended up being the tester. While Tony did help, Ryan was
the one to intially get the group's testing code to work and paved a way to give the rest of the group an idea on how testing code
needed to be accomplished. Ryan also had many various jobs. One of them was creating the start menu on the group's game and getting it
to work and smoothly transition to the first level. Usually the group would decide on what the next few big steps that needed to be to
done to further the completition of the game. After these steps were established, Brandon and Tony would decide on what task would be
best for them to do; anything left over would fall on Ryan's plate. While they may not have been a large, single task capable of taking
up a full sprint's worth of work, many smaller, broken down pieces would need to be done all of which Ryan would accomplish.
