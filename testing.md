##Testing Magma

###Magma Unit Testing

We at Team Magma have been developing unit testing for our game "Magma". Our first section of unit testing was focused
on one of the major factors of the game; movement. We decided to begin our unit testing with movement because the game
would be useless if the characters are not moving properly. The movement testing consists of four different movements
that needed to be tested: Up, Down, Left, Right. Two of our functions passed and two of our functions failed and we
used the same algorithm for all four functions with variations when necessary. We established the units locations,
set the actual value at that units location, set the expected location by manually adding or subtracting the
appropriate axis, then running the actual location through the downward function to see if they matched.

A similiar approach will be given to the other major functions that we still have to create unit tests for; buttons
functionality, and character interactions. We will set the expected results manually, and then call the functions with
the variable we created to see if it performs the way we expected. If it does not we will either adjust our code or
our algorithms appropriately.
